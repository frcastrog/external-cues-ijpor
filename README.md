## Abstract

At a time when the influence of external cues on opinion formation is
gaining attention due to their relevance for preference formation, this
research note investigates how external cues from political elites and
close friends shape individual policy preferences. Building on prior
studies by Barber and Pope (2018, 2023) regarding Donald Trump’s impact
on people’s policy preferences during his 2017-2021 presidency, we
examine whether this influence persists soon after Trump’s first
presidential tenure concludes in late 2021 through a survey experiment.
We also assess the influence of a second external cue that has gained
attention due to the growing role of social media in political
processes: a close friend, who might also serve as a relevant figure for
policy position formation. We find that Trump’s liberal cues shift
Republican preferences in a liberal direction, while close friend cues
show diverse patterns, including some backlash effects where individuals
adopt positions opposite to conservative friend advocacy. These effects
vary with individuals’ party identification, political knowledge, and
social conformity levels. Individual characteristics moderate political
elite influence, while peer influence operates through reactance
mechanisms rather than conformity, revealing that social networks shape
opinions through more complex pathways than commonly theorized.
